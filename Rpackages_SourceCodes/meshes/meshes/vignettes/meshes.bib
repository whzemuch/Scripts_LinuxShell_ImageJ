	abstract = {Reactome is a manually curated pathway annotation database for unveiling high-order biological pathways from high-throughput data. {ReactomePA} is an R/Bioconductor package providing enrichment analyses, including hypergeometric test and gene set enrichment analyses. A functional analysis can be applied to the genomic coordination obtained from a sequencing experiment to analyze the functional significance of genomic loci including cis-regulatory elements and non-coding regions. Comparison among different experiments is also supported. Moreover, {ReactomePA} provides several visualization functions to produce highly customizable, publication-quality figures. The source code and documents of {ReactomePA} are freely available through Bioconductor (http://www.bioconductor.org/packages/{ReactomePA}).},

	shorttitle = {{DOSE}},
	abstract = {Summary: Disease ontology ({DO}) annotates human genes in the context of disease. {DO} is important annotation in translating molecular findings from high-throughput data to clinical relevance. {DOSE} is an R package providing semantic similarity computations among {DO} terms and genes which allows biologists to explore the similarities of diseases and of gene functions in disease perspective. Enrichment analyses including hypergeometric model and gene set enrichment analysis are also implemented to support discovering disease associations of high-throughput biological data. This allows biologists to verify disease relevance in a biological experiment and identify unexpected disease associations. Comparison among gene clusters is also supported.
